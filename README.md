# Houston Music Venue Scraper
A grouping of website scrapers that will scrape the websites of different popular Houston Texas music venues and save the date and name of events from that website.

I am new to coding so the code contained within this repo will be pretty inffecient, but I am using this project as an opprtunity to learn, improve, and educate others on coding. I will try my best to over emphasize comments in the code to try to explain what each line of code does. I am mostly using AI to help educate me on how to code this. Any advice is welcomed. 

Long term, I would like this to: 
*Scrape the websites daily
*Highlight any new events
*Make some kind of web based user interface to nicely view sort all upcoming events
*Make a Spotify and/or Apple Musics playlist with a couple of the top songs of each artist coming to a venue.

Venues I would like to scrape:
*713 Music Hall (https://www.713musichall.com/shows)
*House of Blues Houston (https://www.houseofblues.com/houston/concert-events)
*The Heights Theater (https://www.prekindle.com/theheights/)
*Bayou Music Center (https://www.bayoumusiccenter.com/shows)
*The Continental Club Houston (https://continentalclub.com/houston)
*Shoeshine Charley's Big Top Lounge (https://continentalclub.com/bigtop)
